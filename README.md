    <h1> Preface</h1>
    <p> In  the year 2077, Katara lived with her family in a small town called Sanctuary. Sanctuary was as ordinary a town as any at the time, with suburban aesthetic and people who unanimously enjoyed it. One day, she was surprised with the ring of her door bell. As she opened it to greet the person on the other side, she recognized that it was a worker for the local vault, also known as a fallout shelter. The recruiter enthusiastically (and a bit nervously) attempted to get Katara to sign up to be a member of the local vault in the event that a nuclear bomb exploded.</br> Katara, who began to grow very tired of the man speaking, decided just to sign up so that he would leave her in peace.

She looked at her husband, who she so dearly loved, and sat down next to him on the couch. </br> Suddenly, as if some how fate was aware of her happiness, Katara saw an urgent news interruption pop on to the television screen.

The man was silent for a beat and continued, "everyone near the city of Cambridge, part of the commonwealth, must evacuate to the nearest fallout shelter."
